# Functional Programming C++
Functional Programming features like map, filter and reduce ...etc, even though STL already have those functions(map = std::transform) i tried to implement those features for vectors to use in my day life ... 
Warning: I still learning c++ and functional programming ideas, so this is very incomplete yet , but I will continue integrate as much as I can.

## Map: 
iterates over a vector passing the elements to a function received in the argument, generating the new vector with the items modified by the function. It has its parameter the initial vector and the function that will determine the new vector.

## Filter:

## Reduce:

### There are several ways to implement those features in C++...
